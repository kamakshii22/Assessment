# Health App Data Analysis
### Introduction:
This repository analyzes a health app dataset to understand user activity patterns, workout habits, sleep schedules, and other insights. Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used for data exploration and visualization.
### Data Structure:
The HealthApp_2k.log_structured.csv file contains timestamped events with various details about user activity.
### Analysis Overview
    •Importing Libraries and Loading Data:
      o Utilizing pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
      o Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
      
    •Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
      o Gaining insights into the dataset through basic statistics and visualization.
      o Exploring unique values in 'EventId' and 'EventTemplate.'
      
    •Components Analysis:
      o Visualizing the frequency of each component in the health app.
      
    •Daily Steps Analysis:
      o Preprocessing data to extract daily steps information.
      o Calculating and visualizing daily steps over time.
      
    •Workout Times Analysis:
      o Analyzing workout durations based on relevant events.
      o Visualizing the distribution of workout durations.
      
    •Active Periods Analysis:
      o Visualizing the distribution of events across different times of the day.
      
    •Most Occurring Event Analysis:
      o Identifying and visualizing the frequency of each EventId.
      
    •Sleep Schedule Analysis:
      o Analyzing sleep periods and visualizing a sleep tracker timeline.
      
    •Future Steps and Advanced Analysis:
      o Proposing advanced analysis steps, including machine learning techniques
       for predicting active times, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.
